# KIANIDRAW

Make **ANI**mations from **KI**ds **DRAW**ings

This project is a prototype application to make animated pictures from static pictures. It was originally designed to work on kids drawings, but can in fact serve for any drawing/logo/etc.

For now, it's written in POSIX shell+AWK+M4, but works around GIMP and ImageMagick. It also requires [mvalues](https://github.com/lonequantum/mvalues).

It's a set of subcommands, united under a `kianidraw` command, that work on a user project directory. There is even a Bash autocompletion program.

General documentation, description of the *Kianidraw Animation Language* and code comments will come later.
